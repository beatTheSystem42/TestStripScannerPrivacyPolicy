Privacy Policy for iOS app Test Strip Scanner

Test Strip Scanner does not collect or care about any of your data.
Test Strip Scanner does not know anything about you. No logging in, no accounts, nothing.
The data you create by scanning strips in the app is entirely yours. 
It's all stored locally on your device, so no one has access to it other than you.
You can export images of charts and data, and that is the only way data can leave the app.
But that is entirely up to you. You are in charge of your own data.
Test Strip Scanner does not take any responsibility for your data whatsoever.
It is simply a tool for the user. A very useful tool.
